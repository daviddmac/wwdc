REQUIREMENTS
must be run in a python environment, only tested on python 3.10 in visual studio code

required python modules: urllib, processing_py, re, random, os

HOW TO USE
open core.py in a python code editor

run the file

terminal will ask "Enter website url: " - enter a registered web address

terminal will ask "Enter a title for your art: " - enter the desired name for the output file

terminal will ask "What operating system are you using? W/M/L: " - enter W for windows, M for mac, L for linux
I have not tested this feature on mac or linux so it may not work for them, if it doesn't just edit line 55 to the desired save location on your computer

the program will then run and show you the file it has created, it will also be saved to the desktop (unless you have altered the save location)
